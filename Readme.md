Pneumonia Detection Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Pneumonia is a very common disease.
It can be either: 1) Bacterial pneumonia 2) Viral Pneumonia 3) Mycoplasma pneumonia and 4) Fungal pneumonia. 
This dataset consists pneumonia samples belonging to the first two classes. The dataset consists of only very few samples and that too unbalanced. 
The aim of this kernel is to develop a robust deep learning model from scratch on this limited amount of data using fastai.
